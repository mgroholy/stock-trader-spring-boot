# Assignment: Stock Trader app in Spring Boot

Your task will be to refactor the code of the previous [Stock Trader app](../design-patterns/stock-trader-DI-mocking.md) to use Spring (do this previous assignment first!).

Your task is to rewrite your app to use Spring in a separate branch or repo. The stocks query should be accessible via an `HTTP GET` endpoint at `/buy/<stock>/<price>` instead of the console. Note that converting to Spring will break the tests, but it's OK for now we will discuss how to do unit testing in Spring later.

Hints:
 * Use `@Component` or its sub-annotations to instruct Spring to create an instance at the beginning (= put it in Spring's DI container), you do not need to instantiate your components. Spring will automatically find the constructor parameters if they are in its DI container.
 * Put all your code in packages that are under the main `@SpringBootApplication` class, Spring only scans these classes.
 * Do not put the `@SpringBootApplication` class in the root package, this will cause Spring to try to DI itself and fail.
